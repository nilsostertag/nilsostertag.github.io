            Welcome! My name is Nils and I am an Internet of Things student focusing on Software Engineering, Web Development and Data Science. Because of my major in IoT I have already gained some experience in Software and Web Development as well as in Design and User Experience. I could also deepen and even expand my skillset during multiple internships in the automotive and household appliances industries.
